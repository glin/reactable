floating point and complex numbers are supported, as well as a subset of
trigonometric and statistics functions. Various matrix decompositions are
provided through optional integration with LAPACK and ATLAS libraries.
The 'RcppArmadillo' package includes the header files from the templated
'Armadillo' library. Thus users do not need to install 'Armadillo' itself in
order to use 'RcppArmadillo'. From release 7.800.0 on, 'Armadillo' is

MPL 2.0 from version 3.800.0 onwards and LGPL-3 prior to that;
'RcppArmadillo' (the 'Rcpp' bindings/bridge to Armadillo) is licensed under
the GNU GPL version 2 or later, as is the rest of 'Rcpp'. Note that
Armadillo requires a fairly recent compiler; for the g++ family at least
version 4.6.* is required.","2019-07-15","GPL (>= 2)","http://dirk.eddelbuettel.com/code/rcpp.armadillo.html","yes",NA,1501226,"R (>= 3.3.0)","Rcpp (>= 0.11.0), stats, utils, methods","Rcpp","RUnit, Matrix, pkgKitten, reticulate, rmarkdown, knitr, pinp, slam"
