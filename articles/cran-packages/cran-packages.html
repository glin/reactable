As of release 1.69.0-1, the following Boost libraries are\nincluded: 'algorithm' 'align' 'any' 'atomic' 'bimap' 'bind'\n'circular_buffer' 'compute' 'concept' 'config' 'container' 'date_time'\n'detail' 'dynamic_bitset' 'exception' 'filesystem' 'flyweight' 'foreach'\n'functional' 'fusion' 'geometry' 'graph' 'heap' 'icl' 'integer'\n'interprocess' 'intrusive' 'io' 'iostreams' 'iterator' 'math' 'move' 'mpl'\n'multiprcecision' 'numeric' 'pending' 'phoenix' 'preprocessor'\n'propery_tree' 'random' 'range' 'scope_exit' 'smart_ptr' 'sort' 'spirit'\n'tuple' 'type_traits' 'typeof' 'unordered' 'utility' 'uuid'."]},{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Version"]},"1.69.0-1",{"name":"div","attribs":{"className":"detail-label"},"children":["Author"]},"Dirk Eddelbuettel, John W.
