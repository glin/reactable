# Column group definitions

Use `colGroup()` to create column groups in a table.

## Usage

``` r
colGroup(
  name = NULL,
  columns = NULL,
  header = NULL,
  html = FALSE,
  align = NULL,
  headerVAlign = NULL,
  sticky = NULL,
  headerClass = NULL,
  headerStyle = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- name:

  Column group header name.

- columns:

  Character vector of column names in the group.

- header:

  Custom header renderer. An R function that takes the header value as
  an argument, or a
  [`JS()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/htmlwidgets/man/JS.html) function that
  takes a column object and table state object as arguments.

- html:

  Render header content as HTML? Raw HTML strings are escaped by
  default.

- align:

  Horizontal alignment of content in the column group header. One of
  `"left"`, `"right"`, `"center"` (the default).

- headerVAlign:

  Vertical alignment of content in the column group header. One of
  `"top"` (the default), `"center"`, `"bottom"`.

- sticky:

  Make the column group sticky when scrolling horizontally? Either
  `"left"` or `"right"` to make the column group stick to the left or
  right side.

  If a column group is sticky, all columns in the group will
  automatically be made sticky.

- headerClass:

  Additional CSS classes to apply to the header.

- headerStyle:

  Inline styles to apply to the header. A named list or character
  string.

  Note that if `headerStyle` is a named list, property names should be
  camelCased.

## Value

A column group definition object that can be used to create column
groups in [`reactable()`](reactable.md).

## Examples

``` r
reactable(
  iris,
  columns = list(
    Sepal.Length = colDef(name = "Length"),
    Sepal.Width = colDef(name = "Width"),
    Petal.Length = colDef(name = "Length"),
    Petal.Width = colDef(name = "Width")
  ),
  columnGroups = list(
    colGroup(name = "Sepal", columns = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")),
    colGroup(name = "Petal", columns = c("Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"))
  )
)
